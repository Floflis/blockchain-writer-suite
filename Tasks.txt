To fix (OpenAI's ChatGPT):
- /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/files/file-splitter (the splitter is an obligation ; the jointer is a challenge)
- /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/tools/text-encrypt (beyond AES-128 ECB, also support the up-to-date algo used in TouchPass)
- /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/poster/eth-post-calc (should calc for multiple networks)
-? /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/tools/file-list-serializer

- main bin file, "blockchain-post", using nice green menu
- post to a network: then get {txid}.{network}.bcrf according to the network (either Ethereum, Optimism or Polygon PoS) '/media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/blockchain-writer-suite/poster/blockchain-poster'

Online essential tools to replicate:
- https://encode-decode.com/aes-128-ecb-encrypt-online/ (TouchPass fix)

- new script: post downloader from tx list -> posts database (external repo, already I have one)

- special animation leveraging asciinema (install it on Floflis, pre-installed) on every post https://asciinema.org/a/238491
