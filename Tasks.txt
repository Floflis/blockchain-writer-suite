- /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/files/file-splitter (the splitter is an obligation ; the jointer is a challenge)
-? /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/tools/file-list-serializer
- /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/tools/text-encrypt (beyond the first, also support the up-to-date of TouchPass)
- /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/poster/eth-post-calc (should calc for multiple networks)

- main bin file, "blockchain-post", using nice green menu
- post to a network: then get .bcrf according to the network (either Ethereum, Optimism or Polygon PoS) /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Utilities/eth-post-suite/poster/blockchain-poster
