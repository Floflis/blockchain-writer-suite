- Decode: instead of "$1.base64.decoded.${mime_type#*/}" at line 42, read directly from the input file's prefix
- line 30: use better sed than 's/^data:@file\/[^,]*,//', now not anymore forcing "file"
- line 17: now safe to replace "data:@file/${mime_type#*/};base64," to "data:@${mime_type};base64,"
