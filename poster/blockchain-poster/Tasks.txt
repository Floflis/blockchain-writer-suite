- Don't require the "network" flag, so fallback to Polygon PoS when nothing supplied
- Accept both "--network <name>" and "--network=<name>"!
- Don't differentiate the position of the $3+
- Fixed support for Polygon PoS zkEVM
- Use Ethers+Optimistic L1 gas oracles to estimate gas for Optimism and Base
- Support for all other networks listed on Floflis
