Are you aware about the Ethereum Go tool "ethereal"?

I need a Bash script (blockchain-poster.sh) that leverages either (or both if necessary) geth/ethereal.

Its purpose will be to pick the HEX contents of a .txt file, and send it (Transfer method) to a given ETH address. (yes, these custom HEX messages that begin with 0x, when you're sending 0 ETH just for the purpose of the message in the Transfer).

Then, user will unlock its local wallet and sign to send.
